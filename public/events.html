          <p>Our first two events are amazing - a huge Christmas party for 200 children, and a day with Chelsea FC for 200 more!
            </p>
          <p id="xmas_party" class="yui3-u-5-12">Our first event is our <b>Christmas Party</b>, on 21st December 2011 at the <b>Victory Services Club, London</b>, from 12.30-4pm. Santa will be visiting with a gift for the children; there will be entertainment, dance star party, face painting, craft area, and party food. We haven't forgotten the grown ups! If you fancy a manicure, you can visit the Nail Bar between 1.00pm and 3.30pm. There will be an adult gift bag per family on departure, and the bar will be open! We have representatives from AFF, VSC and other MOD approved authorities available for you to talk to should you wish.
            </p>
          <p id="fc_party" class="yui3-u-5-12">Christmas is quickly followed by our <b> Chelsea Football Club Foundation Event </b> on 2nd January 2012. This is a full day coaching plus surprises at the Chelsea FC Training Ground in Surrey! children 5-12years can apply for this event, however, 
SPACE IS VERY LIMITED AND CHILDREN MUST HAVE A PARENT DEPLOYED OVER CHRISTMAS 2011 TO BE ELIGIBLE. Lunch will be provided and we will be operating a drop off system at the event. Unfortunately, no parents can be admitted to the training ground due to security. More details to follow.</p>
