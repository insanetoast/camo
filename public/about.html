          <p>My Daddy is a Soldier Adventures wants to enhance the support for service children. These children face unique challenges, especially when a parent deploys.</p>

          <img src="/images/louise-and-linda.jpg" />

          <p>Louise (on the left) served in the British Army and saw active service in Kosovo. Her partner is a serving soldier; who has undertaken 6 operational tours of duty since their daughter was born in 2003. Louise is passionate about helping service children through the anxiety of tours having experienced firsthand the impact it can have.</p>

          <p>Linda is married to a serving soldier and has a nine year old daughter. During the last nine years her husband has completed 6 operational tours.  She has lived through the army pressure of being a mummy, 'army wife' and professional.  Linda wants to develop a community which other army parents and children can thrive in and come together to share their experiences too!</p>
